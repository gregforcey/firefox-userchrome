# Custom Firefox `userchrome.css` file

# Description
This userchrome file is design to emulate functionality from the previous Roomy Bookmarks Toolbar Extension that is no longer compatibile with Firefox 57+. Much of the code has been borrowed from `/u/Trustadz` from this [Reddit Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/72qkvt/any_replacement_for_roomy_bookmarks_toolbar_i/). 

The current configuration reduces all the bookmarks bar items to icons and centerâ€™s them on the toolbar. There are other options included that can be uncommented to add additional features including:
* Showing the text of the bookmark on hover
* Removing folder icons
* Auto hide/show the bookmarks toolbar on hover (may not work on windows)

# How to install
Copy the `chrome` folder with the `userchrome.css` file to your Firefox profile folder.
